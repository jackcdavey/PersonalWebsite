        <p>Currently pursuing a B.S. in Web Design and Engineering with a minor in
            Innovation, Design Thinking, and the Entrepreneurial Mindset at Santa Clara University.
            Having spent my entire life in California, I grew up with an immense appreciation for
            the beauty and simplicity of nature. I love to tinker, design, and create, but when I’m
            not working away at my desk, you’ll likely find me at the driving range or exploring
            the mountains with my hammock and camera. </p>
